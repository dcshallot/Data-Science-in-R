# Data-Science-in-R
Data Science in R —— fundamental and industry applications

### Background
ABOUT ME :    

I started using R from 2012, for some text mining jobs. For these years, I have been working in interenet companies including human resources(NASDAQ:ZPIN), games(NASDAQ: CYOU) and some entrepreneurship project. Now , I am in one of the largest technology companies in the world, TENCENT .   

OBJECT:  

To build a framework of how to use R to deal with common analysis jobs, and how to combine models or APIs build by R to the whole big-data architecture of the enterprise.

 

### CATALOG

1. The Data Scientist’s Toolbox： of course R,  and some of my view about big data landscape, includes python, spark, hadoop, GitHub , markdown etc. And ideas like reproducible Research. 
2. Working with R： basic grammar you can find in otherplaces, trying to be different. 
3. Getting and Cleaning Data： read local data, using APIs , db, or odbc/jdbc and etc jobs.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis： descriptive statistics, visualization, espcially in multivariate sense.  
5. Statistical Inference and Variance Analysis： they are a important part of statistics , but , seems not that important in nowadays data sciences. Let's see what we can do. 
6. Regression Models and Classifications： main stream of machine learning 
7. Unsupervised Machine Learning:   clustering and LOF
8. Web Crawler and NLP:  some applications 
9. Time Series Analysis:  practical way, arima , machine learning and other way
10. always changing my mind…
